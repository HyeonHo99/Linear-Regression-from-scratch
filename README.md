    ✔️ Here we build a Linear Regression Model which assumes input features are multiple (input data with single feature is also applicable)

## Error function (Loss function) : Mean Squared Error
<div>
MSE aims to minimize the sum of squared residuals between actual values and predicted values <br>
Formulation is defined as below <br>
